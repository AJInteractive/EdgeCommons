**What is EdgeCommons?**

EdgeCommons is a library for common tasks in Adobe Edge by Simon Widjaja and friends.

**What is Adobe Edge?**

Edge is Adobe's new flagship tool for creative web animations. Still in preview mode but almost ready for prime time. You can get the current preview release right [here](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/edge/)

**Is there a website with some examples and documentation?**

Visit official website at [edgecommons.org](http://www.edgecommons.org)

**Features so far: (more to come)**
- Advanced Logging (different levels, log group and additional log targets)
- Configuration (external or internal Configuration layer)
- Script Loader (JavaScript and CSS with simple callback)
- Sound (integration of CreateJS/SoundJS by Grant Skinner)
- Data Injection (inject Data from HTML into the Edge composition)
- Drupal Module to load Edge compositions and inject data easily (by Timm Jansen)
- We've got plenty more the pipeline ;) 

**Quickstart Guide**
Put this line in the compositionReady event of your Edge composition and you are ready to go:

``yepnope({load: "http://simonwidjaja.github.com/EdgeCommons/live/EdgeCommons-0.3.0.js"});``

Happy Coding,
